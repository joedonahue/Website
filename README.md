COM 372 Final Website

Personal Narrative

===========

One of the things that I have thought about significantly is how I would like a website to look.  I have seen numerous things over the last semester that have inspired me, but one of the biggest things has been making sure that whatever I create has been uniquely my own.  Hopefully, as I continue to delve into this world of web design, I will be able to identify certain things that I can improve.

This website is a result of a semester of learning things that I never thought I could learn before.  It was a semester of saying "Hey, I can do that!"  It was a semester of understanding how HTML works, and knowing that anyone can maintain it.

I have had a very bare-bones knowledge of HTML coming into the course.  As a person responsible for communications of a variety of organizations, I have needed to know how to update a website, and have occasionally looked at HTML tags.  However, CSS was always something completely foreign to me, and I envied those who could use HTML AND CSS (along with JavaScript, which was only incidentally touched upon) to build awesome websites.  This course showed me the tools required to build such sites.

This website is very simple.  It is not complex at all.  However, it is more of a statement that simplicity is not always bad.  One-page websites have always seemed really cool, and this website, albeit a basic one, works in that respect.

The bottom line is that I really enjoyed learning about this stuff, and this website was an opportunity to try out some of the things I learned.
